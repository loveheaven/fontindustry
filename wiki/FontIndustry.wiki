字型制造的工业化革命

Font Industry industrialize procedure of the big charset font production. It
free the big charset font creation from artists' studio into the average John's
basement. The font market will be flooded with huge amount of cheap, low
quality, big charset, hand script font in no time. Be scared! Be very scared!

What does Font Industry really do?
The program converts a scanned in glyph grid sheet into a bitmap font with
automatic encoding index. That's it.

The bitmap font format used is the fontforge .sfd.

A scalable font (TTF, OpenType) can then be generated using fontforge's
autotrace function.

== Dependency ==

  * Python >=2.4 
  * Pygtk
  * Pygoocanvas: GooCanvas python binding. python-pygoocanvas in Debian.
  * Python-gnome-extra. (For gconf python binding.)
  * Python Imaging Library (call python-imaging in Debian).        http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
  
  * You will also want to install [http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/ FontForge] and [http://potrace.sf.net/ potrace]/[http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/ autotrace] for scalable font creation. See [http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/autotrace.html] for more information.

Note: The executable name is *fontin*.

  # Write your font glyphs in a grid sheet.
  # Scan in the sheet at 300dpi or higher resolution.
  # Run the program 'fontin'.
  # Open the scanned image with Font Industy (File-> Open Image)
  # Drag the ruber bands to set the glyph cell size.
  # Create the grid lines for the image. (Action->Create Grid)
  # Repeat 5 to 6 until you are satisfied with the grid.
  # Unset the click buttons in the cell to mark bad cells.
  # Select a charset order from the Order combo box.
  # Set a start character for the set of glyph (Action->Generate Characters)
      You can type in a single character or type in a hex code of the character
      e.g. 0xa1a1.
  # Save the result into Font Industry's native font file. (File->Save)
  # Load another glyph sheet and repeat 4 to 11 until all your glyph are created.
  # Generate fontforge's .sfd font. (File->Export to FontForge)
  # Open the result .sfd font in fontforge.
  # Ask fontforge to autotrace your font to scalable font. (Element->Autotrace)
  # Fine touch the font, set proper font informations.
  # Export to OpenType, TrueType font. (File->Generate Font)
  # ...
  # Profit!

Well, I am sorry that it takes your 19 steps to get to the profit part, but it
is actually quite fast once you get to know the streamline.

P.S. You can hint a end cell by focus on the cell and click the "Toggle End" button. Any cells after this cell will be treated as garbage.

Enjoy your own hand writing font and FLOOD the font market. Don't let me down.
