字型制造的工业化革命

Font Industry industrialize procedure of the big charset font production. It
free the big charset font creation from artists' studio into the average John's
basement. The font market will be flooded with huge amount of cheap, low
quality, big charset, hand script font in no time. Be scared! Be very scared!

What does Font Industry really do?

The program converts a scanned in grid sheet containing a lot of glyphs into a bitmap font. The glyphs will be automatically indexed with unicode. That's it.

The bitmap font format used is the fontforge .sfd.

A scalable font (TTF, OpenType) can then be generated using fontforge's
autotrace function.
