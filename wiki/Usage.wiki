Here are the procedures on how to write your own font. Yes, write the font, not create one.

Basic procedures:
  open image->create grid->generate character index->save font->export .sfd.

== Steps ==
Note: The executable name is *fontin*.

  # Write your font glyphs in a grid sheet. Use the code order for the charset of your choice.
  # Scan in the sheet at 300dpi or higher resolution.
  # Start the Font Industry (the command is 'fontin').
  # Open the scanned image with Font Industy (File->*Open Image*)
  # Drag the ruber bands to set the glyph cell size.
  # Create the grid lines for the image. (Action->*Create Grid*)
  # Repeat 5 to 6 until you are satisfied with the grid.
  # Unset the click buttons in the cell to mark bad cells.
  # Select a charset order from the Order combo box.
  # Set a start character for the set of glyph (Action->*Generate Characters*)
      You can type in a single character or type in a hex code of the character e.g. 0xa1a1.
  # Save the result into Font Industry's native font file. (File->*Save*)
  # Load another glyph sheet and repeat 4 to 11 until all your glyph are created.
  # Generate fontforge's .sfd font. (File->*Export to FontForge*)
  # Open the result .sfd font in fontforge.
  # Ask *fontforge* to autotrace your font to scalable font. (Element->*Autotrace*)
  # Fine touch the font, set proper font informations.
  # Export to OpenType, TrueType font. (File->*Generate Font*)
  # ...
  # Profit!

Well, I am sorry that it takes your 19 steps to get to the profit part, but it
is actually quite fast once you get to know the streamline.

P.S. You can hint an _end cell_ by focus on the cell and click the "Toggle End" button. Any cells after this cell will be treated as garbage.

Enjoy your own hand writing font and FLOOD the font market. Don't let me down.

== Charset Table ==
When write your own font, you will need a grid sheet and a character set table of your character set.
