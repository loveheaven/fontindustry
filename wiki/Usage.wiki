Here are the procedures on how to write your own font. Yes, write the font, not create one.

Basic procedures:
  open image->create grid->generate character index->save font->export .sfd.

== Steps ==
Note: The executable name is *fontin*.
  # Print out a page of grid template. It will be used as a guide while writing glyphs. (Download grid templates from [http://fontindustry.googlecode.com/files/gridTemplates-1.1.tar.bz2 here])
    Hint: For charset GB2312/GBK, a 96 cell glyph sheet make it easier to track code point. A 48 cell glyph sheet can be used for big calligraphy.
  # Write your font glyphs on a piece of paper. Use the grid template created above as the background. Write the glyphs in the code order for the charset of your choice.
    Tip: Use a clip to stick the foreground and background papers together.
  # Scan in the sheet at 300dpi or higher resolution. Save images in the .png format.
  # Start the Font Industry (the command is 'fontin').
  # Open the scanned image with Font Industy (File->*Open Image*)
  # Drag the ruber bands to set the glyph cell size.
  # Create the grid lines for the image. (Action->*Create Grid*)
  # Repeat 6 to 7 until you are satisfied with the grid.
  # Unset the click buttons in the cell to mark bad cells.
  # Select a charset order from the Order combo box.
  # Set a start character for the set of glyph (Action->*Generate Characters*)
      You can type in a single character or type in a hex code of the character e.g. 0xa1a1.
  # Save the result into Font Industry's native font file. (File->*Save*)
  # Load another glyph sheet and repeat above steps until all your glyph sheet are processed.
  # Generate fontforge's .sfd font. (File->*Export to FontForge*)
  # Open the resulting .sfd font in fontforge.
  # Export the font into a bitmap font (File->*Generate Font*).
  # Open a new font, import the previous bitmap font as background. (File->Import... and select As Background)
  # Select all the glyphs. (Edit->Select->Select All)
  # Ask *fontforge* to autotrace your font to scalable font. (Element->*Autotrace*)
  # Fine touch the font, set proper font informations.
  # Select all and Remove the background images. (Edit->Clear Background)
  # Export to OpenType, TrueType font. (File->*Generate Font*)
  # ...
  # Profit!

Well, I am sorry that it takes your more than 20 steps to get to the profit part, but it is actually quite fast once you get to know the streamline.

*TIP*: You are suggested to pre-process the scanned images with [http://potrace.sourceforge.net/mkbitmap.html mkbitmap] before use the images in the font industry. mkbitmap is a utility of the [http://potrace.sourceforge.net potrace] program. For example:
{{{
convert image.png ppm:- |mkbitmap -f 10 -s 3 -t 0.46 |convert pbm:- blackwhite-image.png
}}}
which converts an image by applying a high pass filter of 10 (-f 10), then scale up by 3 (-s 3) and finally, convert to black & white bitmap using 0.46 as the middle point (-t 0.46). convert is a tool of [http://www.imagemagick.org/index.php ImageMagick].

In a batch nut shell:
{{{
#!/bin/sh
for i in "$@" ; do
 outname="bw-${i}.png"
 echo "Saving to ${outname}..."
 convert "$i" ppm:- | mkbitmap -x -f 10 -s 3  -t 0.46  | convert pbm:- "${outname}"
done
}}}

*P.S.* You can hint an _end cell_ by focus on the cell and click the "Toggle End" button. Any cells after this cell will be treated as garbage.

Enjoy your own hand writing font and FLOOD the font market. Don't let me down.

== Charset Table ==
When write your own font, you will need a grid sheet and a character set table of your character set.
